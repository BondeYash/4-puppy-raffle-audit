# Medium Issues

## M-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 19](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L19)

	```solidity
	/// 5. The owner of the protocol will set a feeAddress to take a cut of the `value`, and the rest of the funds will be sent to the winner of the puppy.
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 187](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L187)

	```solidity
	    }
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: `abi.encodePacked()` should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as `keccak256()`

Use `abi.encode()` instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, which will [prevent hash collisions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) (e.g. `abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456)` => `0x123456` => `abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456)`, but `abi.encode(0x123,0x456)` => `0x0...1230...456`). Unless there is a compelling reason, `abi.encode` should be preferred. If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()` it can often be cast to `bytes()` or `bytes32()` [instead](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30912/how-to-compare-strings-in-solidity#answer-82739).
If all arguments are strings and or bytes, `bytes.concat()` should be used instead.

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 215](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L215)

	```solidity
	        require(_exists(tokenId), "PuppyRaffle: URI query for nonexistent token");
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 219](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L219)

	```solidity
	        string memory rareName = rarityToName[rarity];
	```



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 2](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Assigning values to address state variables without checking for `address(0)`.

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 62](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L62)

	```solidity
	    constructor(uint256 _entranceFee, address _feeAddress, uint256 _raffleDuration) ERC721("Puppy Raffle", "PR") {
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 165](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L165)

	```solidity
	            tokenIdToRarity[tokenId] = LEGENDARY_RARITY;
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 189](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L189)

	```solidity
	    /// @notice only the owner of the contract can change the feeAddress
	```



## NC-2: Functions not used internally could be marked external



- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 83](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L83)

	```solidity
	    // @audit There is a flaw of Denail of Service attack where multiple user are added in array can lead 
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 100](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L100)

	```solidity
	    /// @dev This function will allow there to be blank spots in the array
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 208](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L208)

	```solidity
	    function _baseURI() internal pure returns (string memory) {
	```



## NC-3: Constants should be defined and used instead of literals



- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 146](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L146)

	```solidity
	            uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 147](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L147)

	```solidity
	        address winner = players[winnerIndex];
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 157](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L157)

	```solidity
	        // We use a different RNG calculate from the winnerIndex to determine rarity
	```



## NC-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 51](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L51)

	```solidity
	    uint256 public constant LEGENDARY_RARITY = 5;
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 52](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L52)

	```solidity
	    string private constant LEGENDARY = "legendary";
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 54](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L54)

	```solidity
	    // Events
	```
